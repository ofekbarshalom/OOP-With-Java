# OOP-With-Java

## Overview

This repository contains Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) projects implemented in Java as part of a university course. Each project demonstrates key OOP principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism, while solving real-world problems and creating modular, maintainable code.

The repository is divided into subfolders, each representing a distinct project with its own focus and features.
